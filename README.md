# nCounter: A WatchOS 4 demo App

#### This is the final product for the step-by-step tutorial on https://medium.com/@mehul_parmar/watchos-4-getting-started-1e8472539112

The app is designed for WatchOS 4, and is written in XCode 9, swift 4.

The final product after building and running this app looks like shown below. 

The tutorial walks you through creating your first watch ⌚️ OS app, adding the interface elements, responding to the updates from the digital crown, updating the UI in real-time, and interacting with the phone app.

As can be seen in the image below, rotating the digital crown updates the count value in the watch app, and this value is then passed to the companion phone app, which then reflects the new value (with a noticable delay).
